2. **02_data_ingestion.sql** - Creates RAW_PRODUCTS table with 15 products (5 seconds)
3. **03_ai_enrichment.sql** - Uses llama3.1-8b to enhance data (2-3 minutes) ‚è±Ô∏è
4. **04_semantic_search.sql** - Creates Vector embeddings with e5-base-v2 (30 seconds)
5. **05_rag_functions.sql** - Creates ASK_PRODUCT_CATALOG procedure (10 seconds)
6. **06_marketing_functions.sql** - Creates marketing automation procedures (10 seconds)

- Paste into Snowflake worksheet
- Click "Run All"
- Wait for completion

#### 2.3 Verify Setup ‚úÖ

After running all scripts, verify everything was created successfully.

**Expected Results:**
- Tables: 4-5
- Procedures: 5

Click **Create**

#### 3.3 Add Code

You'll see a code editor with default code.

**Delete all default code** (Ctrl+A, Delete)

**Open the file**: `streamlit_app/streamlit_snowflake.py` from the repository

**Copy entire contents** of that file

**Paste** into Snowflake Streamlit editor

#### 3.4 Run the App

Click **Run** button (top-right)

Wait 10-20 seconds for initialization

Your app is now live! üéâ

## üß™ Testing Your Deployment

### Test in Snowflake Worksheets

Open a worksheet and test the stored procedures:

**Test 1: Semantic Search**
```
CALL SEMANTIC_SEARCH('laptop for coding', 5);
```

**Test 2: Q&A System**
```
CALL ASK_PRODUCT_CATALOG('What is the cheapest product?');
```

**Test 3: Marketing Email**
```
CALL GENERATE_MARKETING_EMAIL(1);
```

**Test 4: Analytics**
```
SELECT * FROM CATEGORY_ANALYTICS;
CALL GENERATE_INSIGHTS();
```

### Test Streamlit App

Open your Streamlit URL and test all 5 pages:
- ‚úÖ Home - View dashboard
- ‚úÖ Semantic Search - Try searching "laptop"
- ‚úÖ Ask Questions - Ask something
- ‚úÖ Analytics - Generate insights
- ‚úÖ Marketing Tools - Generate email

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Model unavailable in your region"

**Error Message:**
```
Model llama3.1-8b unavailable in your region
```

**Solution:**
Enable cross-region inference. Run in a worksheet:
```
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
ALTER ACCOUNT SET CORTEX_ENABLED_CROSS_REGION = 'ANY_REGION';
```
Wait 2 minutes, then retry the failed script.

---

### Issue: "Insufficient privileges"

**Error Message:**
```
SQL access control error: Insufficient privileges to operate on schema 'CATALOG'
```

**Solution:**
Verify you're using ACCOUNTADMIN role. If not, switch roles and re-run the script.

---

### Issue: "Table does not exist"

**Error Message:**
```
Object 'CATEGORIZED_PRODUCTS' does not exist
```

**Solution:**
You skipped a SQL script. Scripts must run in order (01 ‚Üí 07). Check which tables exist and re-run missing scripts.

---

### Issue: Streamlit app shows error

**Error:**
Connection error or blank screen

**Solution:**
- Check warehouse is running (may be suspended)
- Resume warehouse if needed
- Verify app has permissions
- Refresh Streamlit app (click "Rerun" in app)

---

### Issue: Streamlit not showing in sidebar

**Error:**
Can't find "Streamlit" option in sidebar

**Solution:**
- Ensure you're ACCOUNTADMIN role
- Check your Snowflake edition supports Streamlit
- Try refreshing the page
- Contact Snowflake support if issue persists

---

## üîÑ Updating Your Deployment

### Update Data

Add new products by inserting into RAW_PRODUCTS table, then re-run enrichment scripts (03-04)

### Update Streamlit App

1. Go to **Streamlit** in sidebar
2. Click on **Product_Catalog_AI**
3. Click **Edit** button
4. Modify code
5. Click **Run**

Changes are live immediately!

### Update SQL Functions

Re-run the SQL script with `CREATE OR REPLACE` to update existing procedures

## üí∞ Cost Management

### Understanding Costs

| Component | Cost | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| **Warehouse** | ~$2-4/hour | Only when running |
| **Storage** | Minimal | Sample data is small |
| **Cortex AI** | $0.50-2/day | Based on usage |

### Cost Optimization

**1. Auto-Suspend (Already Configured)**
- Warehouse auto-suspends after 60 seconds of inactivity

**2. Monitor Usage**
- Check warehouse usage in Snowflake console
- Review Cortex API calls in query history

**3. Suspend When Not Needed**
- Manually suspend warehouse when done testing
- Resume when needed

**4. Limit Cortex Usage**
- Use Cortex judiciously in production
- Cache frequent queries if possible

---

## üìä Monitoring

### Check Warehouse Status

In Snowflake, go to Admin ‚Üí Warehouses to see:
- Warehouse status (Running/Suspended)
- Credits used
- Query count

### Check Query History

View recent queries and their performance in:
- Activity ‚Üí Query History

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

### User Access

Grant only necessary permissions:
- Read-only users: SELECT on tables/views
- Power users: EXECUTE on procedures
- Admins: Full access

### Data Privacy

- Sensitive data should be masked
- Use row-level security for multi-tenant
- Audit access regularly

---

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### Git Integration (Optional)

Connect your GitHub repo to Snowflake for automated deployments

### Scheduled Refresh

Set up tasks to refresh enriched data automatically

### Custom Domains

Use Snowflake's external access features for custom URLs

---

## üìö Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. ‚úÖ Test all features thoroughly
2. ‚úÖ Customize AI prompts for your use case
3. ‚úÖ Add your own product data
4. ‚úÖ Share app URL with stakeholders
5. ‚úÖ Monitor costs and usage
6. ‚úÖ Consider adding new features
